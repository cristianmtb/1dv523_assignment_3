## URL
## Node Modules used
#### ExpressJS
#### ReactJS
   Chose it because I find it fast and easy to build front ends with. Also it offers XSS protection by default.
#### Express-ws
  https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-ws
  Offers WebSocket endpoints for express. I chose websockets because they offer more freedom than libraries like Socket.io
#### Octonode
  https://github.com/pksunkara/octonode
  Suggested in the assignment in order to authenticate github api calls.

  https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv
